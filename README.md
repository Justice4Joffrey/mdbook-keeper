# mdBook-Skeptic

mdBook-skeptic adds testing features to mdBook. My hope is that it will be merged
into mdBook at some point in the future.

Current goals include: 

 - Specifying third-party crates to include when testing a mdbook.
 - Running tests as part of the build, rather than as a seperate command.
 - Only running tests on code that has changed.
 - The ability to see compilation or build output as part of the book
   (both to aid in debugging, and possibly also as a permanent output).
